If I don't treat you like a lady.
You won't hold my hand.
And you don't like it when I call you baby.
Don't you understand.
Even though we don't see eye to eye.
That's no reason to say goodbye.
You gotta learn to give and take.
There's so much love we can make.
Even though we might be having a few doubts.
Let's take the time and try to work things out.
The little things we fuss and fight about.
Ain't gonna matter 100 years from now.
I admit I'm a little lazy, isn't everyone?
And you let things drive you crazy.
Sometimes you act so young.
Even though we don't realize.
We'd be foolish not to compromise.
Cause what we have is all we've got
Believe it or not
We've really got a lot

Even though we might be having a few doubts.
Let's take the time to try to work things out.
The little things we fuss and fight about.
Ain't gonna matter 100 years from now.
